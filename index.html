        The lord Krishna is considered as the avatar of the god Bishnu. The god
        Bihsnu himself took the krishna avatar to end the oppresion of Kansha
        who is known to be the mamashree of krishna and king of Mathura. The
        residence of Mathura had to endure the prolong oppression of kansha.
        kansha treated them as an animal followed by his cruel behaviour toward
        the civilians. So, to end the abuse the Bishnu himself came to earth and
        took the human form and that human form of Bishnu is known as Krishna.
        Nevertheless, the Krishna avatar also played a very key role in the mahabharat which was fought to establish the "Dharma" in earth. <br>
